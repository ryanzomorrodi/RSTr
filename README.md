The Rate Stabilizing Tool R Package (RSTr): Gibbs Samplers for Bayesian Spatiotemporal CAR Models

The RSTr package is a tool that uses Bayesian spatiotemporal models in conjunction with C++ to help you quickly and easily generate spatially smoothed estimates for your spatiotemporal small area data. For the ArcGIS Python Toolbox, visit the [Rate Stabilizing Toolbox (RSTbx)](https://github.com/CEHI-code-repos/RateStabilizingToolbox).

## Installation

Install the development version via [r-universe](https://cehi-code-repos.r-universe.dev/RSTr).

```r
install.packages('RSTr', repos = c('https://cehi-code-repos.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

If this is your first time using RSTr, check out `vignette("RSTr")` to learn how to use the package.

## Thanks!
Thanks for checking out the RSTr package. I hope you find it useful in your spatiotemporal modeling! Please feel free to give feedback on bugs, ways to make the package more accessible to use, and features you'd like to see added to the package.
