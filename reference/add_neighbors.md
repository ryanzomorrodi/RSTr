# Add neighbors to adjacency information

Modifies `adjacency` to indicate that `neighs` they should be treated as
neighbors.

## Usage

``` r
add_neighbors(adjacency, neighs)
```

## Arguments

- adjacency:

  Adjacency information generated by
  [`spdep::poly2nb()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/poly2nb.html).

- neighs:

  A list of regions to mark as adjacent. Accepts a vector of indices or
  names assigned to `adjacency`.

## Value

A modified `adjacency` `list`.

## Details

`add_neighbors()` is useful when adjacency information generated by
[`spdep::poly2nb()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/poly2nb.html)
indicates lone regions without links/neighbors, particularly in island
counties such as the Hawaiian islands, Nantucket in Massachusetts, or
San Juan in Washington. Note that `add_neighbors()` marks all listed
counties as adjacent, so if you have a set of chaining counties where
the first may not be connected to the last, several instances of
`add_neighbors()` will be needed.

## Examples

``` r
mamap <- sf::st_as_sf(mamap[order(mamap$GEOID), ])
ma_adj <- spdep::poly2nb(mamap)
#> Warning: some observations have no neighbours;
#> if this seems unexpected, try increasing the snap argument.
#> Warning: neighbour object has 3 sub-graphs;
#> if this sub-graph count seems unexpected, try increasing the snap argument.
new_neighs <- c(1, 4, 10) # attach regions 1, 4, and 10
ma_adj <- add_neighbors(ma_adj, new_neighs)

# Add neighbors by FIPS code instead of index
ma_adj <- suppressWarnings(spdep::poly2nb(mamap))
names(ma_adj) <- mamap$GEOID
ma_adj <- add_neighbors(ma_adj, neighs = c("25001", "25007", "25019"))

ma_adj <- suppressWarnings(spdep::poly2nb(mamap))
ma_adj <- add_neighbors(ma_adj, c(1, 4)) # only attach 1 and 4
ma_adj <- add_neighbors(ma_adj, c(4, 10)) # only attach 4 and 10
```
