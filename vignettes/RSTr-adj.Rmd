## Overview {#sec-overview}

The adjacency structure is a set of instructions that show the spatial relationship between each region and informs `RSTr` which counties to pull information from when spatially smoothing. In this vignette, we will cover the requirements for the `adjacency` object along with walking through the setup of the adjacency information.

## Requirements

Adjacency information is input as a `list` `adj` where each element `adj[[i]]` is a vector of indices denoting regions that are neighbors of region `i`. Below, we will walk through the construction of the adjacency information and address common issues that may arise.
