## Overview

-   RSTr's models help to smooth estimates with low event counts
-   What if events are too low?
-   Standard BYM models oversmooth in these regions
-   Need to restrict the model informativeness
-   Discuss how informativeness works
-   How do estimates differ between unrestricted/restricted models
-   When should you use one model over the other
-   Developments in restricted models
